# ABCD-NDV-CBC

Hey there, thanks for stopping by. Apologies for the incomplete page - aiming to get the code all up by this weekend (Memorial Day wknd). 

I am always in awe of reading others' scripts when they are well-commented. Comments are the bedrock of reproducible science! I am always trying to improve, so if you have suggestions please share. Feel free to reach out to me with any questions about the scripts: hughesdy@g.ucla.edu
